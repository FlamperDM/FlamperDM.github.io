                Hello there, my name is Flampeyeiry Diaz, a software engineer based in Boston, MA.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since I was a kid, I was a fanatic of Blizzard and Nintendo videogames which 
                made me inspired to make games just like they do with those great Arts, UX, 
                Stories, and ideas to run those games. While I was living in the Dominican Republic, 
                I was trying to learn how to make video games just from meetups and youtube. 
                I joined a Dominican community for game developers on Facebook, since we donâ€™t have 
                that industry in my country. I have met a team to made a startup where we made a 
                demo named Witchpires. At the end of  2017, I decided to move to the United State 
                to find greats opportunities to grow as a Software Engineer. I enrolled at Bunker 
                Hill Community College in Boston MA to learn English. In there I met and joined Hack 
                Diversity which helped me with mentorship, coaching, networking, have my first internship 
                in the USA named Carbon Black, and joined XR Terra where I got certificated from VR &amp; 
                AR developer program.
                <br />
                <br />
                Now in 2020, I got accepted to the Oculus Launchpad and looking to connect with 
                other entrepreneurial-minded people to make amazing games that are accessible across all platforms.
                <br />
                <br />
                Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
